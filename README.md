Experiments on ML systems creating self-reinforcing bias

## Phase 1: Logistic Regression

This phase will be the easiest, and will most-obviously work.
More sophisticated ML will come later.

The idea is to show that training a model without explicitly recording or looking for negative training examples will produce bias in a wide variety of situations.
